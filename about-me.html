		<p>
		<div id="text"><h1><u>Dante Gaytan</u></h1><br><h3>My name is Dante Gaytan. For a large portion of my life, I resided in Austell, Georgia. This brought a lot of adversity to me and my family, including violence, harrasment by police and teachers. This made life hard, but we got by. At school, I would always put that behind me and made a name for myself. No one at my elementary school knew my upbringing or my economic status. All they knew about me was my academics since that's the only thing I let anyone see. I din't have many friends, and those that I did have didn't remain that way for very long. Once I had finally began making real friends, which was in the Fourth-Grade, I had to move for better financial and academic opportunity.<br><br>
		Since then, I've made friends that have been with me longer than any other had before. Even after that, I enhanced my Academic ability even more with better classes and less distracting environments. Once I moved, I was finally able to be myself, which is someone that I had no idea I was before. On this new journey that I have been on for the past few years, I have discovered and enhanced myself in almost every way: mentally, physically, and socially.</h3></p>
