		<div id="Dante"><h1><u>Dante Gaytan</u></h1><br><h3>My name is Dante Gaytan. For a large portion of my life, I resided in Austell, Georgia. This brought a lot of adversity to me and my family, including violence, harrasment by police and teachers. This made life hard, but we got by. At school, I would always put that behind me and made a name for myself. No one at my elementary school knew my upbringing or my economic status. All they knew about me was my academics since that's the only thing I let anyone see. I din't have many friends, and those that I did have didn't remain that way for very long. Once I had finally began making real friends, which was in the Fourth-Grade, I had to move for better financial and academic opportunity.<br><br>
		Since then, I've made friends that have been with me longer than any other had before. Even after that, I enhanced my Academic ability even more with better classes and less distracting environments. Once I moved, I was finally able to be myself, which is someone that I had no idea I was before. On this new journey that I have been on for the past few years, I have discovered and enhanced myself in almost every way: mentally, physically, and socially.</h3></p>

		<div id="Tyler"><h1><u>Tyler Mathieu</u></h1><br><h3><p>  I Am The Best ME.I'm Tyler Mathieu, What set me aside from 		other's is my determination to always be a better me. I was born in Miami, Florida on July 20, 2004. When I was 		younger I never understood the true meaning of school. I use to always take it to grant until 5th grade when I was 		tested for honor classes. It showed people see more in me then I do. Since the 5th grade, I was an honor roll student 	  until I get my first C in 9th grade. Some Achievements In my Life are winning the 8th-grade principal award, Honor 		Roll, Getting Promoted to Officer in JROTC and Becoming a SMASH Scholar.<br><br>
			Further On, A little better insight on me is that I'm A rising 10th grader at Mundy's Mill High School. At Mundy's Mill, I participate in Track & JROTC. I am also a Current SMASH scholar at Morehouse College. Upon graduation, I plan on attending a for year institution to Major in Political Science. I plan on either attending Morehouse College or Howard University. It takes a lot to stay determined when it's distractions everywhere around you. I bring all credit to my parents for raising me to always fight my battles no matter how difficult it can be.
